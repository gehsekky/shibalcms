<h1 class="page-header">Shibal CMS</h1>
<p>ShibalCMS is a Content Management System written in PHP with an MVC-oriented architecture. The core is meant to be as simple as possible while any functionality can be added via modules.</p>
<p>TODO:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Design and implement better routing mechanism. Also, consider pure software SEO-friendly url system so we don't have to depend on web server (optional).</li>
	<li>Implement generic list view other modules can inherit off of?</li>
	<li>Clean up core/ and put some manager classes in with their respective modules.</li>
	<li>Provide an AJAX interface for reordering menu items.</li>
	<li>Ability to provide custom error pages.</li>
</ul>
