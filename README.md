# Shibal CMS

ShibalCMS is a Content Management System written in PHP with an MVC-oriented 
architecture. The core is meant to be as simple as possible while any 
functionality can be added via modules.

TODO:

* Design and implement better routing mechanism. Also, consider pure software 
SEO-friendly url system so we don't have to depend on web server (optional).
* Implement generic list view other modules can inherit off of?
* Clean up core/ and put some manager classes in with their respective modules.
* Provide an AJAX interface for reordering menu items.
* Ability to provide custom error pages.
